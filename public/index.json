This paper focuses on the decoding of EEG signals to Chinese words, and proposes a novel framework, EEGTCW, which is based on the BiGRU-Attention-CNN classification model and data augmentation method to decode EEG signals into categories corresponding to Chinese words on a self-built dataset.

The paper introduces a comprehensive approach to transforming textual descriptions into structured visual diagrams, addressing challenges in automated diagram creation and iterative editing. By establishing a new benchmark, the authors provide a robust evaluation platform for future research in this interdisciplinary domain of computer vision and natural language processing. Their framework leverages advanced techniques to enable precise, context-aware diagram generation, offering significant potential for applications in education, technical documentation, and data visualization.\nThis achievement highlights the team’s dedication to advancing the integration of language and visual processing, paving the way for more intuitive and automated visualization tools. Congratulations to Jingxuan Wei, Cheng Tan, Qi Chen, Gaowei Wu, Siyuan Li, Zhangyang Gao, Linzhuang Sun, Bihui Yu, and Ruifeng Guo for their outstanding contribution to CVPR 2025!\nRead the full paper here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.11916\n","date":1740614400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1740614400,"objectID":"26ba21cfc75e220d529131a7f9fa8ac4","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/post/congratulations-on-cvpr-2025-publication/","publishdate":"2025-02-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/congratulations-on-cvpr-2025-publication/","section":"post","summary":"中国科学院沈阳计算所多模态认知智能团队“From Words to Structured Visuals: A Benchmark and Framework for Text-to-Diagram Generation and Editing”文章被计算机视觉与模式识别会议(CVPR 2025)接受，CVPR是计算机视觉领域最具权威、最高水平、最具影响力的国际顶级学术会议之一，为CCF A类会议。\n","tags":null,"title":"Congratulations on CVPR 2025 Publication","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1666569600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666569600,"objectID":"6d99026b9e19e4fa43d5aadf147c7176","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/contact/","publishdate":"2022-10-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/contact/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Contact","type":"landing"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1666569600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666569600,"objectID":"c1d17ff2b20dca0ad6653a3161942b64","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/people/","publishdate":"2022-10-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/people/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"People","type":"landing"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1666569600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666569600,"objectID":"b0d61e5cbb7472bf320bf0ef2aaeb977","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/tour/","publishdate":"2022-10-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/tour/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Tour","type":"landing"}]
