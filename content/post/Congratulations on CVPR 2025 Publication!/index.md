We are excited to celebrate the acceptance of the paper "From Words to Structured Visuals: A Benchmark and Framework for Text-to-Diagram Generation and Editing" by Jingxuan Wei, Cheng Tan, Qi Chen, Gaowei Wu, Siyuan Li, Zhangyang Gao, Linzhuang Sun, Bihui Yu, and Ruifeng Guo at CVPR 2025!

This innovative work  presents a pioneering benchmark and framework for text-to-diagram generation and editing. The paper introduces a comprehensive approach to transforming textual descriptions into structured visual diagrams, addressing challenges in automated diagram creation and iterative editing. By establishing a new benchmark, the authors provide a robust evaluation platform for future research in this interdisciplinary domain of computer vision and natural language processing. Their framework leverages advanced techniques to enable precise, context-aware diagram generation, offering significant potential for applications in education, technical documentation, and data visualization.

  This achievement highlights the team's dedication to advancing the integration of language and visual processing, paving the way for more intuitive and automated visualization tools. Congratulations to Jingxuan Wei, Cheng Tan, Qi Chen, Gaowei Wu, Siyuan Li, Zhangyang Gao, Linzhuang Sun, Bihui Yu, and Ruifeng Guo for their outstanding contribution to CVPR 2025!
