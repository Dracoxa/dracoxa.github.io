abstract: With the evolution of artificial intelligence technology and the exploration of brain science, more and more researchers are committed to the decoding of brain signals, and the application of brain-computer interface(BCI) is constantly updated. Electroencephalogram(EEG) signals are non-invasive signals that have attracted increasing attention due to their non-transplantability and high temporal resolution. This paper focuses on the decoding of EEG signals to Chinese words, and proposes a novel framework, EEGTCW, which is based on the BiGRU-Attention-CNN classification model and data augmentation method to decode EEG signals into categories corresponding to Chinese words on a self-built dataset. The classification accuracy reaches 0.88, while exploring the gener-alization performance of the model under different batches of a single subject and generalization performance across subjects. It has certain reference value for the improvement of BCI assistant system for speech disorder people.
